# github-actions

## Task List

Phase 1: Basics

âœ… 1. Create a GitHub repository for testing GitHub Actions.

âœ… 2. Read about GitHub Actions concepts (Workflow, Job, Step, Action).

âœ… 3. Create a .github/workflows/first-workflow.yml file.

âœ… 4. Write a workflow that prints "Hello, GitHub Actions!" on push.

âœ… 5. Trigger your workflow by pushing a commit.

âœ… 6. Modify the workflow to run on both push and pull request events.

Phase 2: Automating Tasks

âœ… 7. Add a step to checkout your repository (actions/checkout).

âœ… 8. Run a simple shell command in the workflow.

âœ… 9. Add a step that installs dependencies (e.g., npm install, pip install).

âœ… 10. Modify the workflow to only run on specific branches.

âœ… 11. Use environment variables inside your workflow.

Phase 3: CI/CD Basics

âœ… 12. Set up a job to lint code using a linter (e.g., ESLint for JavaScript, flake8 for Python).

âœ… 13. Run unit tests in your workflow (e.g., pytest, jest).

âœ… 14. Cache dependencies to speed up workflows (actions/cache).

âœ… 15. Store artifacts from a build process.

Phase 4: Advanced CI/CD

âœ… 16. Deploy a static website to GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions.

âœ… 17. Set up a workflow to build and push a Docker image to Docker Hub.

âœ… 18. Deploy an application to a cloud platform (AWS, GCP, Azure, Vercel, etc.).

âœ… 19. Use secrets to store sensitive credentials (e.g., API keys).

âœ… 20. Create a matrix build to test on multiple versions of a language (e.g., Node.js, Python).

Phase 5: Custom Actions & Optimization

âœ… 21. Create a reusable workflow for multiple repositories.

âœ… 22. Write a custom GitHub Action using JavaScript or Docker.

âœ… 23. Use concurrency to cancel previous runs on new commits.

âœ… 24. Implement job dependencies (needs: keyword).

âœ… 25. Use conditional steps to run actions only when specific conditions are met.

Phase 6: Security & Best Practices

âœ… 26. Enable required status checks before merging.

âœ… 27. Restrict workflows to run only on pull requests from specific branches.

âœ… 28. Use GitHub Actions OIDC for secure cloud authentication.

âœ… 29. Review and limit permissions for GitHub Actions tokens.

âœ… 30. Set up Slack or Discord notifications for workflow results.

Final Challenge:

ðŸš€ 31. Build a full CI/CD pipeline for a real-world project using GitHub Actions.
