# Phase 3:

As I continue my journey with GitHub Actions, I wanted to take automation a step further by implementing a Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline. This pipeline ensures that my code adheres to best practices by running linting and tests every time changes are pushed or a pull request is created.

In this post, Iâ€™ll walk you through the steps I took to:

âœ… Set up a GitHub Actions CI pipeline for JavaScript and Python.

âœ… Use matrix builds to run jobs for both languages.

âœ… Perform linting with ESLint (JavaScript) and flake8 (Python).

âœ… Run unit tests using Jest (JavaScript) and pytest (Python).

By following along, you'll gain hands-on experience with setting up a structured CI workflow in GitHub Actions. Letâ€™s get started! ðŸš€

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the workflow, I ensured that my project contained:

- A JavaScript project with a `package.json` file containing ESLint and Jest.
- A Python project with a `requirements.txt` file specifying dependencies.
- A `.github/workflows` directory to store the workflow configuration.

## Step 1: Creating the "develop" Branch

First, I cloned my GitHub repository to my local machine:


```bash
git clone https://github.com/ELemenoppee/github-actions
cd phase-3/
```

## Step 2: Creating the GitHub Actions Workflow File

I created a new workflow file inside `.github/workflows/phase-3-workflow.yaml`:

```bash
touch .github/workflows/phase-3-workflow.yaml
```

This file will contain my GitHub Actions configuration.

## Step 3: Configuring the CI Workflow

Hereâ€™s the full YAML configuration of my CI pipeline:

```yaml
name: CI Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  lint:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        language: [javascript, python]
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Set up Python
        if: matrix.language == 'python'
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: '3.10'

      - name: Install dependencies (Python)
        if: matrix.language == 'python'
        run: |
          cd phase-3/my-python-project
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install -r requirements.txt flake8

      - name: Check Installed Python Packages
        if: matrix.language == 'python'
        run: python -m pip list

      - name: Run flake8 (Python)
        if: matrix.language == 'python'
        run: |
          cd phase-3/my-python-project
          flake8 --exit-zero .

  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: lint
    strategy:
      matrix:
        language: [javascript, python]
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Set up Node.js (for JavaScript)
        if: matrix.language == 'javascript'
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 18

      - name: Cache Node.js dependencies
        if: matrix.language == 'javascript'
        uses: actions/cache@v4
        with:
          path: ~/.npm
          key: ${{ runner.os }}-node-${{ hashFiles('phase-3/my-javascript-project/package-lock.json') }}  
          restore-keys: |
            ${{ runner.os }}-node-

      - name: Install dependencies (JavaScript)
        if: matrix.language == 'javascript'
        run: |
          cd phase-3/my-javascript-project
          npm install

      - name: Run Jest tests (JavaScript)
        if: matrix.language == 'javascript'
        run: |
          cd phase-3/my-javascript-project
          npm test

      - name: Set up Python
        if: matrix.language == 'python'
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: '3.10'

      - name: Cache Python dependencies
        if: matrix.language == 'python'
        uses: actions/cache@v4
        with:
          path: ~/.cache/pip
          key: ${{ runner.os }}-pip-${{ hashFiles('phase-3/my-python-project/requirements.txt') }}
          restore-keys: |
            ${{ runner.os }}-pip-

      - name: Install dependencies (Python)
        if: matrix.language == 'python'
        run: |
          cd phase-3/my-python-project
          pip install -r requirements.txt

      - name: Run pytest (Python)
        if: matrix.language == 'python'
        run: |
          cd phase-3/my-python-project
          pytest
```

## Step 4: Pushing the Workflow and Verifying Execution

To test the workflow, I made a small change to my repository and pushed it:

```bash
echo "Test CI Pipeline" >> test.txt
git add test.txt
git commit -m "Test CI Pipeline"
git push origin main
```

Then, I checked my GitHub Actions dashboard to verify that the workflow ran successfully. If everything was set up correctly, the linting and testing jobs should pass.

## What I Learned

This project helped me understand how to set up an automated CI pipeline with GitHub Actions. Some key takeaways:

âœ… How to configure GitHub Actions for JavaScript and Python projects.

âœ… Using matrix builds to run jobs for multiple languages.

âœ… Automating linting with ESLint and flake8.

âœ… Running unit tests using Jest and pytest.

âœ… Caching dependencies to improve workflow efficiency.

This has been a great learning experience, and Iâ€™m excited to build on it further! ðŸš€
